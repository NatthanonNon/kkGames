There is a large setup violation of -9.985 ns between display/FSM/state_divider_reg[10]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and display/FSM/state_divider_reg[8]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
