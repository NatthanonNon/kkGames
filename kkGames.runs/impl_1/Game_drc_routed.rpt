2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net display/FSM/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin display/FSM/id_row_4_reg[4]_i_1/O, cell display/FSM/id_row_4_reg[4]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net display/FSM/id_row_2_reg[4]_i_2[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin display/FSM/id_row_2_reg[4]_i_1/O, cell display/FSM/id_row_2_reg[4]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net display/FSM/id_row_3_reg[4]_i_2[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin display/FSM/id_row_3_reg[4]_i_1/O, cell display/FSM/id_row_3_reg[4]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net display/FSM/video_home_on_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin display/FSM/video_home_on_reg_i_2/O, cell display/FSM/video_home_on_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net display/dodge_screen/flame_monster_unit/form_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin display/dodge_screen/flame_monster_unit/form_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell display/dodge_screen/flame_monster_unit/form_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net display/vsync_unit/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin display/vsync_unit/change_reg[25]_i_2/O, cell display/vsync_unit/change_reg[25]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net display/vsync_unit/h_count_reg_reg[7]_20[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin display/vsync_unit/name_row_3_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell display/vsync_unit/name_row_3_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check

This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net display/vsync_unit/h_count_reg_reg[7]_22[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin display/vsync_unit/name_row_2_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell display/vsync_unit/name_row_2_reg[4]_i_2.
